			<p>Hamsters are highly popular pets for many reasons. They are fun to watch, they take little space, they can exercise themselves and they require little work to care for properly. This makes them good for first-time pet owners and for children learning responsibility, but a prospective owner must be aware of a few potential drawbacks. Hamsters are predominantly nocturnal, thus they are known for being awake and active while their owners are asleep and vice versa. As rodents, they require gnawing blocks to wear down their incisor teeth or they will gnaw anything else that they can find. Children must be warned to handle hamsters gently because they are delicate animals. They live only 2-4 years, so they may not be ideal for a prospective owner seeking a long-lived companion.</p>
