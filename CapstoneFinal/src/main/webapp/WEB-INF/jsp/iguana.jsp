			<p>Iguanas are favorites among pet enthusiasts who seek something more unique than a dog or a cat but cannot commit to a bird. They are strictly herbivorous, so they are much easier to feed than most other reptiles that are kept as pets, and their diurnal nature means that most owners will not be woken up by their iguanas at night. There are some concerns to be aware of, though. Iguanas, like all reptiles, are cold-blooded and require proper climate control to be kept healthy. They are particularly large lizards and naturally arboreal, so they need large enclosures and space to climb, which can make them expensive to accommodate. In addition, they do not enjoy physical contact and are better left for observation than handling. Finally, they are considered exotic pets and are thus illegal in some locales, so research your local laws before committing to ownership.</p>
