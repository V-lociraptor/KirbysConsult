			<p>Ferrets are niche pets that are commonly mistaken for wild animals, but they are domesticated through and through. That said, as is the case with any pet, there are pros and cons to keeping them. They are highly social and capable of entertaining themselves when kept in pairs, but interact poorly with other pet species like cats and dogs (ferrets are predators as well, so they may try to prey on smaller pets if left unsupervised). They greatly enjoy playing with their owners, but their favorite game is "hide and seek"; their natural curiosity will lead them to explore every nook and cranny of their home and even escape outdoors if given a chance, so they must be supervised at all times when let out of their cage. They greatly enjoy collecting and playing with their toys, but they also tend to recognize "their toys" as "anything they can carry", so important or dangerous items must be kept out of their reach. These animals are also notorious for their odor which, though it can be mitigated by measures like monthly bathing and long-term owners will grow accustomed to it, never truly goes away. Ferrets are illegal in the states of California and Hawaii and some smaller regions of other states, so always research local laws before committing to ownership.</p>
