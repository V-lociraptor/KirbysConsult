			<p>Birds are high-maintenance, high-reward animals that can grow to become extremely fun and loving pets to have around the house. They have plenty of affection and entertainment to offer to a well-prepared and caring owner, but be warned that they are also perhaps the most demanding indoor pets, often likened to toddlers who never grow up. They tend to be extremely messy and much, much noisier than other pets. Many of them are highly intelligent and will find ways to entertain themselves if they are bored, which can often mean destruction to furniture and household items (some parrots have even learned to use voice-activated technology!). They must be allowed out of their cages for daily exercise, so your home must have room for them to roam. Owners who are elderly or develop significant health problems must have arrangements made for the animal to be cared for in the event of the owner's passing, as some birds can live for decades and may unexpectedly outlive an unprepared owner. Some species are forbidden to keep as pets in certain areas, so research your local laws before committing to one.</p>
