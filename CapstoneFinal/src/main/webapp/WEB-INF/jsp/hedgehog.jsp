			<p>Hedgehogs are surprisingly energetic creatures that can give any household a breath of new life! Hedgehog lovers have many praises to sing of these animals. They are easy to care for, simple to keep (they thrive on a diet of cat food), entertaining to watch, and produce far less odor than most pets (they prefer to disguise their scent as that of the bedding in their cages). However, while some of their quirks seem good, a prospective owner must be aware of more obstacles than their quills. They live only about five years at most, with any specimen over three years of age being considered elderly. They are nocturnal and can run up to five miles every night, so they must have a strong exercise wheel that must be cleaned daily and may need to be kept distant from people trying to sleep. They require more climate control than most mammals, only functioning well in an environment kept 73-80 degrees Farenheit at all times. They are largely solitary animals, so they must be kept separate from each other and may take a long time to grow accustomed to their owners, if ever. Lastly, these animals are still considered exotic pets and are outlawed in some states, including California and Hawaii. Check local laws regarding pets before committing to owning one.</p>
