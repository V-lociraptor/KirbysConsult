			<p>Dogs are the most popular pets in America and are known as "man's best friend" for very good reason. They offer boundless affection and loyalty to a good owner and many different breeds have many different uses (from hunting to herding to home defense), but have much to be wary of as well. Many dogs shed heavily and require regular brushing. They need regular exercise, so must be given a regular walk or a large outdoor space to run and play. While they are often excellent for cuddling, they also have a penchant for climbing onto furniture with their owners, which results in couches and chairs being covered in fur. Some larger breeds are banned in certain cities in the United States, so further research into the breed you intend to adopt is essential.</p>
