			<p>Non-venomous constrictor snakes are widely kept as pets by those who want a non-disruptive, easy-to-care-for animal companion. They are easily kept happy with a simple terrarium and a weekly meal. In addition, most pet snakes respond well to being handled by their owners, especially if they are desensitized from a young age. A prospective owner, however, must know their needs. A terrarium must be kept secure; snakes are nimble enough to escape from a poorly-secured terrarium and may find themselves in danger. Various species of snake have various needs regarding food, space and veterinary attention. They all share some common traits, though, including a need for a controlled climate and a diet of fresh, usually live, meat. They are not suitable pets for squeamish owners.</p>
