			<p>Mice play many roles in the world. They are recognized as vermin in many cases and they are used sometimes as food for pets, but they themselves can be great pets as well! They often enjoy being handled, require very little money and work for upkeep, are surprisingly tidy animals and are active throughout the day. Things that a prospective owner needs to be aware of include their potential interactions with other pets; they are prey. Any household that already owns a cat, dog, ferret, snake or similar predatory pet is likely an unsuitable home for a mouse. Mice are highly social and should not be kept alone; they should always be kept in groups of two at minimum. They require tightly-barred cages and careful supervision when outside their cages to prevent escape, as well as gnawing blocks to keep their rodent incisors worn down. Lastly, they live only about two to three years at most, so they may be a poor choice for people who want a long-lasting companionship from a pet.</p>
