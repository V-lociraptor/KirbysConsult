			<p>Cats are friendly, comforting animals and one of the most popular pets in the world. They can make a brilliant addition to a home looking for a lap pet or a playful friend and require little experience to care for effectively, but an owner must still prepare properly. Most cats have no problem being left home alone during the day and they do not need to be taken outside for walks, but their playful nature means that they must be given a way to entertain themselves and kept away from important items. They tend to enjoy attention, but are notorious for demanding it at inopportune times (do not be surprised if one lies down on your keyboard while you are typing!). They require either a litter box that must be kept clean or easy access to an enclosed outdoor space. Owners who choose the latter route must be prepared for deceased "presents" to be frequently brought to the door. Cats are natural predators and must be kept away from smaller pets such as rodents.</p>
