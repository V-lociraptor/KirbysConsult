			<p>Rabbits rose to fame thanks in no small part to the likes of beloved fictional characters like Bugs Bunny and Judy Hopps, but their real-world counterparts hold a place in the hearts of many as well. These animals are intelligent enough to understand orders and even learn to use a litter box. Their quiet and diurnal nature means that they are among the least disruptive pets to an owner's sleep schedule and are good for apartments, and they are simple enough and sturdy enough to be suitable for inexperienced pet owners. However, they have some drawbacks including heavy needs for waste cleanup and relatively low temperature tolerances. Like rodents, rabbits require gnawing blocks or their incisors will grow excessively. They can be surprisingly expensive to own and some breeds can live over twenty years, so they can be a surprisingly heavy commitment.</p>
