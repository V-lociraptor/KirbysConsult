			<p>There are those who believe that "slow and steady wins the race" and turtle owners are likely to agree. These reptiles have docile temperaments and they are widely beloved for it. Their dietary needs are largely simple, as most species of turtles are herbivorous (and would be happy to receive some leftover fresh produce before it spoils), and they are slow enough that they are at little risk of being lost even if they escape an aquarium or terrarium. Even these animals have needs, though. Like all other reptiles, they require a heat lamp and shade or similar form of climate control. Ownership of one of these animals is a long commitment, as they can live for many years (some species can survive over four decades; outliving the owner is a real concern). There are numerous different species of turtles and all have different needs, so further and more specific research would always be required before a commitment is made.</p]>
