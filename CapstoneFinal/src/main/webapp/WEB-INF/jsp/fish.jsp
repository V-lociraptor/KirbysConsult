			<p>Many species of fish are kept as pets throughout the United States. They are often kept as pets for "decoration" more than for interactive pet ownership. Proper maintenance of an aquarium is an excellent learning experience, but demands a steep learning curve; aquarium upkeep and maintenance is a complex process and the already-pricey affair can be made more expensive if mistakes are made. Fish are overall much less needy for attention and care than most pets, but they are extremely diverse and different species have different needs, so always research their needs before purchasing an aquarium.</p>
