			<p>Guinea pigs are simple and low-maintenance pets that are good for helping children learn about responsibility. Guinea pigs are active during the daytime unlike some animals of similar size, so they are more compatible with most sleep schedules, but they have other challenges to watch for. As prey animals, they typically dislike being handled. Like all rodents, they require gnawing blocks or similar items to gnaw on to keep their incisor teeth worn down, or else they will find other objects, such as electrical cables, to gnaw instead when they are out of their cage. They are notoriously noisy among rodents. Though they often dislike being handled, Guinea pigs are highly social and will become depressed and unhealthy if they are alone (though males must be kept separate or they will fight). Only adopt a Guinea pig if you are prepared to care for at least two.</p>
